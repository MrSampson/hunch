 * Write `data` to `file` via a temp file + rename, so an interrupted write can't

 *
 * Durability (issue #34): the temp file is fsync'd BEFORE the rename, and the
 * parent directory best-effort after it. A process kill was always safe (page
 * cache preserves ordering), but on power loss / OS crash the rename's metadata
 * could reach disk before the temp file's data blocks — leaving the target
 * present but truncated or garbage, the exact state the atomic-write invariant
 * (con_902759b3dc) exists to prevent.
 *
 * Windows caveat: renameSync can't REPLACE a file another process holds open (even
 * for read) — it throws EPERM/EBUSY/EACCES, exactly when the MCP server is reading
 * while a CLI writes. Retry that atomic replacement with bounded backoff. If the
 * contention persists, fail with the old target untouched; never trade availability
 * for a direct write that an interruption could truncate. Failed writes clean up the
 * temporary file.
